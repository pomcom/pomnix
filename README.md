- These are my current NixOS / Home_manager configuration files for different setups i am using on a daily basis. 
- Tips of any kind are welcome.

## Credits
The whole structure of this repository is based on [Misterio77](https://github.com/Misterio77)'s [nix-config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config).
Those resources helped me so much to get started. Thanks a lot!

Check out his [Starter config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) for a cool starting point if you're interested in [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_package_manager).


Also check out this [human](https://github.com/jdsee), who also (most of the time) has a nice nix config.
